AI can be misused in a variety of ways. It can be used to promote cheating in schools, such as writing essays or solving simple math equations. It can be used as a way to sway groups of people on a certain topic, such as creating fake images/videos to fool them. However, there are ways to manage misuse and prevent misinformation or plagiarization, such as putting restrictions on which data can be used by a model, how much of it is used (for privacy), and determining who can use it. AI, as a whole, demonstrates how people view the value of privacy, who should have access to these models, which opens a world of ethics and understanding how much information we should share.
